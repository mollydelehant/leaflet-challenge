# leaflet-challenge

I used online resources and previous class lessons to help me create my code. I chose different earthquake data than what was used in the hw example. My data is showing earthquakes over a month. I really struggled with getting the legend to output a color gradient to correspond with my markers which I recognize would add a lot of value to the map.
